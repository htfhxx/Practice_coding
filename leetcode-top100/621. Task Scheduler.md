Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks. Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative cooling interval n that means between two same tasks, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.

You need to return the least number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

 

Example:
```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
 ```

Note:
```
The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].
The integer n is in the range [0, 100].
```

##### 代码思路
```
样例1：
["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
2
调度：AB-AB-AB

样例2：
["A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E"]
2
调度：ABCADEA--A
```
即调度的长度依赖于数目最多的任务
例如数目最多的任务数量为m，冷却时间为n，则最长是(m-1)(n+1)+cnt. 其中cnt是与A同样多的任务的数量。



##### 代码实现

```
class Solution {
public:
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
        if(tasks.empty()==true)
            return 0;
        int len=tasks.size();
        vector<int> nums(26,0);
        for(int i=0;i<len;i++)
            nums[tasks[i]-'A']++;
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        int cnt=0;
        for(int i=0;i<26;i++)
            if(nums[i]==nums[25])
                cnt++;
        return max(len,(nums[25]-1)*(n+1)+cnt);
    }
};


```
